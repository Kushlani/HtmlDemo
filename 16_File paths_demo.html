HTML File Paths
A file path describes the location of a file in a web site's folder structure.

File paths are used when linking to external files like:

Web pages
Images
Style sheets
JavaScripts</pre></b>

    <h2>Absolute File Paths</h2>
    <p>An absolute file path is the full URL to an internet file:</p>
    <img src="https://www.w3schools.com/images/picture.jpg" alt="Mountain">
    <br>
    <br>

    <h2>Relative File Paths</h2>h
    <p>A relative file path points to a file relative to the current page.
    In this example the file path points to a file in the images folder located at the root of the current web:</p>
    <img src="/images/picture.jpg" alt="Mountain">
    <br>
    <br>

    <h2>In this example the file path points to a file in the images folder located in the current folder:</h2> 
    <img src="images/picture.jpg" alt="Mountain">
    <br>
    <br>

    <h2>In this example the file path points to a file in the images folder located in the folder one level above the current folder:</h2> 
    <img src="../images/picture.jpg" alt="Mountain">
